# class excercise:

class Musician: 
	def __init__(self, genre, instrument, age):
		self.genre = genre
		self.instrument = instrument
	
	def__init__(self):

class Birthday:
	def birthday(month,day,year)


# (2) Create three instances of Musician

rick_astley = Musician('pop', 'beautiful voice')
guns_n_roses = Musician('rock', 'guitar')
stevie_wonder = Musician('r&b', 'piano')

# (3) Make a list that holds your three instances

artists = [rick_astley, guns_n_roses, stevie_wonder]

for x in artists: 
	print x.instrument
